***SesMailer***

A simple e-mail wrapper, written for [node](http://nodejs.org), so we can send e-mail through AWS SES.

*To Install*

First, make sure you have [node](http://nodejs.org) installed.  You can download it here ([http://nodejs.org/download/](http://nodejs.org/download/)).  When you install node, make sure it's added to your path.

Once node is installed, run the following command:

    npm install https://github.com/KCL5South/SesMailer/tarball/master

This will install SesMailer in a `node_modules` directory in the current working directory.
